# Nano
If you're wandering through the east end of Adelaide and find yourself craving a quick, tasty bite without breaking the bank, Nano on Ebenezer Place might just be your spot. This little cafe packs a punch with its menu variety and incredibly reasonable prices, making it a popular choice for both locals and city wanderers alike.

Nano's setting is unpretentious with a focus on what matters: good food and fast service. While the interior might not win any design awards—coming off a bit dingy—the vast array of outside tables more than makes up for it, allowing you to enjoy your meal in the bustling atmosphere of the city's east end. This setup is perfect for a sunny day, giving you a front-row seat to the lively street scene while you dine.

The food here is straightforward but delicious, with options that cater to a variety of tastes and preferences. Whether it's brunch or lunch, Nano seems to nail the flavors, especially considering the price point. The coffee is notably inexpensive for the city and arrives quickly, brewed well enough to please any coffee enthusiast. However, the service style might confuse first-timers; it's a counter service where you order and pay first, but then they'll bring your food and drinks to your table.

Despite its few quirks, such as the smaller serving sizes and the less-than-cozy interior, Nano remains a gem for those in the know. It's the kind of place you go for a quick, satisfying meal without any fuss, right in the heart of one of Adelaide’s most charming neighborhoods. If you're looking for a no-frills spot with fast service and solid food and coffee, Nano is worth a stop.
