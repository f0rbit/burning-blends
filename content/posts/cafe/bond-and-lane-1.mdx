description: "A tucked away indiecore cafe that doesn't oversell itself. The food and coffee matches what you would think based on the exterior, a no-suprises delicious and ethically sourced drink station with a delicious kitchen to match. If you're ever in the area, this is probably a go-to spot."

# Bond & Lane
I recently visited a cozy café that left quite an impression on me. The moment I walked in, I was greeted by the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee. However, I initially found the seating process a bit confusing due to the lack of clear signage indicating whether it was a “find your own table” or “wait to be seated” setup. Eventually, we decided to grab some menus and find our own table, discovering that it was indeed a self-seating arrangement where you order at the counter.

On this particular visit, the service was notably slow, likely because it was a busy time and our arrival was at an odd hour. The interior was quite loud and noisy, especially when crowded, but the beautiful vines adorning the walls added a charming touch. I also appreciated the self-serve water station, a small but thoughtful detail.

My friend ordered the batch brew, which came with a lovely spoon and an informative card about the coffee farmer, a cute and cool touch that I really liked. While the coffee was good, the food was even better. The burger, though a bit sloppy with the sauce, was a delightful eating experience, and the standard chips complemented it well.

Overall, I would consider revisiting this café if I were in the area, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to visit. It’s a nice spot with a pretty standard indie café interior that’s currently trending, but nothing life-changing.
