# The Garden Cafe
I visited this café about a month ago at the time of writing this, but it left a good impression in my memory (well done!). The entrance to this café, located in Seacliff, is a bit confusing. You have to go in through the side, which I think was smart because their outdoor seating looks really inviting and comfy. The interior has this gorgeous dark brown wooden flooring, and mixed with the green plants scattered around, it creates your typical eco-friendly warm aesthetic. Personally, I love this aesthetic.

Initially, we were the only people in the café, but as we were eating, more and more people came in. The café soon filled with loud discussions and occasional laughter. While the entrance is confusing, there's a sign immediately indicating that you should go up and ask for a seat or wait to be seated, so bonus points for that. The service was pretty fast for both the coffee and the food, but we were the only ones there at the time, so it makes sense. Overall, the service was pretty good.

The mocha was made beautifully, and the green mugs really enhanced the eco-friendly design—huge love for that. The presentation of my meal (the chicken toastie) was pretty good. My friend got the burger, and I was pretty jealous; it looked delicious. The lettuce in my toastie was a bit old, I felt, but the chicken was mm mm mm yummyyy. I would go here again if I’m in the Seacliff area.
