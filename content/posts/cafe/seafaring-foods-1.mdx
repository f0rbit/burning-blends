# Seafaring Fools

Seafaring Fools is a popular café around the Broadway area, serving some pretty delicious standard food. The interior is fairly boring, with a few cool paintings on the wall but not much else to look at. However, the seating arrangements are very appealing both inside and outside. It wasn’t too loud, but I imagine that's because it wasn't too busy. There wasn't any signage indicating whether it was table service or order at the counter, but it was table service, I'm pretty sure. The freely available table water is a huge bonus for this café.

The food arrived quite promptly, and the juice I ordered was superb. It was the perfect mixture of sweetness and healthiness. The chips, however, were pretty bland, despite the burger being a beautiful combination of freshness and cooked meat. I think the juice would be the main selling point of this café.

If I were in the area again, I'd consider going here, especially with a larger group of friends as there are plenty of big tables to sit outside. However, there are definitely better cafes nearby that offer similar quality service & food for cheaper price.
