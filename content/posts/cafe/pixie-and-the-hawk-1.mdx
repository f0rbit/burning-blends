# Pixie and the Hawk

We went to this café on Sunday before a big hike, as usual. This café is definitely out of my usual stomping grounds, and with its small exterior, you could easily miss it. However, it has a lovely outside seating area at the back, though it's quite small with only three tables. Luckily, it wasn’t too busy on this Sunday morning, so we easily grabbed a table. My friends ordered some colorful drinks—the pink one was a “Turkish Delight” latte, and the purple one was literally just called “Purple Latte.”

Anyway, I got a mocha as usual, and it was pretty good. For $5, this is probably one of the best mochas I've had by far—definitely better than the ones I make myself, so that’s a huge win. The meal I ordered (“Back to Cluck”) was a bit pricey at $26.90, but it came with these potato gems that were absolutely delicious. I could have ordered a whole bowl of those and been happy. Also, the sandwich looked a bit big, but it wasn’t too hard to eat in terms of height, which is something a lot of cafés seem to struggle with these days. I don’t think my mouth is that small, but maybe I’m doing something wrong—dislocate my jaw, perhaps?

I didn’t try the fancy, weird coffees, but they were a tad more expensive at $5.80. I doubt they were as delicious as the mocha, so I’ll stick with my usual next time. The interior and exterior design of this cute little café really sells it. They nailed it with the passageway on the side of the store leading to the back. It was full table service outside—not sure how things operated inside—but we got table water right away, and the turnover was pretty quick. This is definitely a contender for the top café in the area.
