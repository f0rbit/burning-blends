# Summertown Studio
Recently, I had the pleasure of spending my morning at Summertown, a uniquely charming cafe that doubles as a record store, nestled in the quiet suburbs between Glenelg and Brighton. It’s the perfect spot for a relaxed weekend escape, with a stylish yet welcoming interior that boasts an indie aesthetic, lush plant life, and ample natural light. The outdoor area is lovely for those sunny days, although some seating is open to the elements.

The cafe has a laid-back vibe where you can comfortably work or enjoy a good book. It’s clear that every detail in the place is thoughtfully curated to enhance the relaxed, artsy atmosphere. From the aesthetically pleasing decor to the soothing background of vinyl records, everything about Summertown invites you to settle in and stay awhile.

On to the food and drinks: the sandwich I tried was absolutely delicious and priced very fairly at $14. You may find yourself waiting a couple of minutes for your coffee, but I can assure you it’s because each cup is crafted with extra care. The mocha here stands out—it’s rich, smooth, and deeply satisfying, a testament to their dedication to quality.

The staff at Summertown add to the overall positive experience; they are friendly and seem genuinely happy to be there, which makes the atmosphere all the more inviting. Even though the service might take a moment longer, it's clear that they're focused on quality. Summertown is definitely a must-visit for anyone who loves a great combination of superb coffee, tasty food, and the timeless appeal of vinyl records.
